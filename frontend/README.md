This folder is dedicated to all UI/UX work for the BillBuddy project, including:
- Builder.io AI-generated pages and components
- Figma design exports
- UI assets (images, icons, etc.)
- Design documentation and prompts

## Instructions for Builder.io
- Use this folder as the root for all frontend and UI/UX code.
- Reference the DESIGN_BRIEF.md in the main project root for detailed requirements and style guide.
- All generated code, assets, and documentation should be placed here.

## Collaboration
- Frontend/UI/UX contributors should work within this folder.
- Backend and infrastructure code should remain outside this folder to keep concerns separated.

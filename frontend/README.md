# BillBuddy Frontend (Builder.io UI/UX)

<!-- Test commit for backend sync workflow -->

This folder is dedicated to all UI/UX work for the BillBuddy project, including:
- Builder.io AI-generated pages and components
- Figma design exports
- UI assets (images, icons, etc.)
- Design documentation and prompts

## How to run just the UI (Frontend)

1. Open a terminal and navigate to this directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Visit the local URL provided by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173)

## Instructions for Builder.io
- Use this folder as the root for all frontend and UI/UX code.
- Reference the DESIGN_BRIEF.md in the main project root for detailed requirements and style guide.
- All generated code, assets, and documentation should be placed here.

## Collaboration
- Frontend/UI/UX contributors should work within this folder.
- Backend and infrastructure code should remain outside this folder to keep concerns separated.

**If you have exported code or assets from Builder.io, place them in this folder or subfolders as appropriate.**
